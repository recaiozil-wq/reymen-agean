## When to Reach for Playwright / Cypress

JSDOM (used by Vitest/Jest) cannot:

- Render real layout (flexbox, grid, viewport queries)
- Run native browser animation, CSS transitions
- Test scrolling behavior, drag-and-drop, paste from clipboard
- Handle iframes, popups, downloads, cross-origin flows
- Run real network in a controlled environment with full DevTools support

For any of those, use Playwright Component Testing (component test in real browser) or full E2E. See [e2e-testing skill](../e2e-testing/SKILL.md).

Decision boundary:

- A hook, a presentational component, a form with logic -> RTL
- A component whose layout matters or that uses browser APIs not in JSDOM -> Playwright CT
- A full user flow across multiple pages -> Playwright/Cypress E2E
