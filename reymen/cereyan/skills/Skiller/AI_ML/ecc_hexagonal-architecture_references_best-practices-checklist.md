## Best Practices Checklist

- Domain and use-case layers import only internal types and ports.
- Every external dependency is represented by an outbound port.
- Validation occurs at boundaries (inbound adapter + use-case invariants).
- Use immutable transformations (return new values/entities instead of mutating shared state).
- Errors are translated across boundaries (infra errors -> application/domain errors).
- Composition root is explicit and easy to audit.
- Use cases are testable with simple in-memory fakes for ports.
- Refactoring starts from one vertical slice with behavior-preserving tests.
- Language/framework specifics stay in adapters, never in domain rules.
