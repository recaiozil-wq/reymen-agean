## Anti-Patterns

### Common Mistakes

1. **Infinite loops without exit conditions** — Always have a max-runs, max-cost, max-duration, or completion signal.

2. **No context bridge between iterations** — Each `claude -p` call starts fresh. Use `SHARED_TASK_NOTES.md` or filesystem state to bridge context.

3. **Retrying the same failure** — If an iteration fails, don't just retry. Capture the error context and feed it to the next attempt.

4. **Negative instructions instead of cleanup passes** — Don't say "don't do X." Add a separate pass that removes X.

5. **All agents in one context window** — For complex workflows, separate concerns into different agent processes. The reviewer should never be the author.

6. **Ignoring file overlap in parallel work** — If two parallel agents might edit the same file, you need a merge strategy (sequential landing, rebase, or conflict resolution).
