## Communication Patterns

### Tone Calibration

- **Vendor routine reorder:** Transactional, brief, PO-reference-driven. "PO #XXXX for delivery week of MM/DD per our agreed schedule."
- **Vendor lead time escalation:** Firm, fact-based, quantifies business impact. "Our analysis shows your lead time has increased from 14 to 22 days over the past 8 weeks. This has resulted in X stockout events. We need a corrective plan by [date]."
- **Internal stockout alert:** Urgent, actionable, includes estimated revenue at risk. Lead with the customer impact, not the inventory metric. "SKU X will stock out at 12 locations by Thursday. Estimated lost sales: $XX,000. Recommended action: [expedite/reallocate/substitute]."
- **Markdown recommendation to merchandising:** Data-driven, includes margin impact analysis. Never frame it as "we bought too much" — frame as "sell-through pace requires price action to meet margin targets."
- **Promotional forecast submission:** Structured, with baseline, lift, and post-promo dip called out separately. Include assumptions and confidence range. "Baseline: 500 units/week. Promotional lift estimate: 180% (900 incremental). Post-promo dip: −35% for 2 weeks. Confidence: ±25%."
- **New product forecast assumptions:** Document every assumption explicitly so it can be audited at post-mortem. "Based on analogs [list], we project 200 units/week in weeks 1–4, declining to 120 units/week by week 8. Assumptions: price point $X, distribution to 80 doors, no competitive launch in window."

Brief templates appear above. Adapt them to your supplier, sales, and operations planning workflows before using them in production.
