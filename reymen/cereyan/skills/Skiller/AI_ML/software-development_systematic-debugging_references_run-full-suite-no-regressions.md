### 4. If Fix Doesn't Work — The Rule of Three

- **STOP.**
- Count: How many fixes have you tried?
- If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
- **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)**
- DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion

### 5. If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture

**Pattern indicating an architectural problem:**
- Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling in a different place
- Fixes require "massive refactoring" to implement
- Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

**STOP and question fundamentals:**
- Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
- Are we "sticking with it through sheer inertia"?
- Should we refactor the architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?

**Discuss with the user before attempting more fixes.**

This is NOT a failed hypothesis — this is a wrong architecture.
