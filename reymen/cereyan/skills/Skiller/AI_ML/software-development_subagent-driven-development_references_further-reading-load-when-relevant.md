## Further reading (load when relevant)

When the orchestration involves significant context usage, long review loops, or complex validation checkpoints, load these references for the specific discipline:

- **`references/context-budget-discipline.md`** — Four-tier context degradation model (PEAK / GOOD / DEGRADING / POOR), read-depth rules that scale with context window size, and early warning signs of silent degradation. Load when a run will clearly consume significant context (multi-phase plans, many subagents, large artifacts).
- **`references/gates-taxonomy.md`** — The four canonical gate types (Pre-flight, Revision, Escalation, Abort) with behavior, recovery, and examples. Load when designing or reviewing any workflow that has validation checkpoints — use the vocabulary explicitly so each gate has defined entry, failure behavior, and resumption rules.
