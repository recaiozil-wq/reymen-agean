## Sampling (Server-Initiated LLM Requests)

ReYMeN supports MCP's `sampling/createMessage` capability — MCP servers can request LLM completions through the agent during tool execution. This enables agent-in-the-loop workflows (data analysis, content generation, decision-making).

Sampling is **enabled by default**. Configure per server:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  my_server:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "my-mcp-server"]
    sampling:
      enabled: true           # default: true
      model: "gemini-3-flash" # model override (optional)
      max_tokens_cap: 4096    # max tokens per request
      timeout: 30             # LLM call timeout (seconds)
      max_rpm: 10             # max requests per minute
      allowed_models: []      # model whitelist (empty = all)
      max_tool_rounds: 5      # tool loop limit (0 = disable)
      log_level: "info"       # audit verbosity
```

Servers can also include `tools` in sampling requests for multi-turn tool-augmented workflows. The `max_tool_rounds` config prevents infinite tool loops. Per-server audit metrics (requests, errors, tokens, tool use count) are tracked via `get_mcp_status()`.

Disable sampling for untrusted servers with `sampling: { enabled: false }`.
