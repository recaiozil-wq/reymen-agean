## Troubleshooting

### "MCP SDK not available -- skipping MCP tool discovery"

The `mcp` Python package is not installed. Install it:

```bash
pip install mcp
```

### "No MCP servers configured"

No `mcp_servers` key in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, or it's empty. Add at least one server.

### "Failed to connect to MCP server 'X'"

Common causes:
- **Command not found**: The `command` binary isn't on PATH. Ensure `npx`, `uvx`, or the relevant command is installed.
- **Package not found**: For npx servers, the npm package may not exist or may need `-y` in args to auto-install.
- **Timeout**: The server took too long to start. Increase `connect_timeout`.
- **Port conflict**: For HTTP servers, the URL may be unreachable.

### "MCP server 'X' requires HTTP transport but mcp.client.streamable_http is not available"

Your `mcp` package version doesn't include HTTP client support. Upgrade:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mcp
```

### Tools not appearing

- Check that the server is listed under `mcp_servers` (not `mcp` or `servers`)
- Ensure the YAML indentation is correct
- Look at ReYMeN Agent startup logs for connection messages
- Tool names are prefixed with `mcp_{server}_{tool}` -- look for that pattern

### Connection keeps dropping

The client retries up to 5 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, capped at 60s). If the server is fundamentally unreachable, it gives up after 5 attempts. Check the server process and network connectivity.
