## Workflow States

Linear uses `WorkflowState` objects with a `type` field. **6 state types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `triage` | Incoming issues needing review |
| `backlog` | Acknowledged but not yet planned |
| `unstarted` | Planned/ready but not started |
| `started` | Actively being worked on |
| `completed` | Done |
| `canceled` | Won't do |

Each team has its own named states (e.g., "In Progress" is type `started`). To change an issue's status, you need the `stateId` (UUID) of the target state — query workflow states first.

**Priority values:** 0 = None, 1 = Urgent, 2 = High, 3 = Medium, 4 = Low
