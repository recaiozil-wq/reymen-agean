## Important Notes

- Always use `terminal` tool with `curl` for API calls — do NOT use `web_extract` or `browser`
- Always check the `errors` array in GraphQL responses — HTTP 200 can still contain errors
- If `stateId` is omitted when creating issues, Linear defaults to the first backlog state
- The `description` field supports Markdown
- Use `python3 -m json.tool` or `jq` to format JSON responses for readability
