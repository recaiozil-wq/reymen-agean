## Setup

### 1. Get an integration token (required for both paths)

1. Create an integration at https://notion.so/my-integrations
2. Copy the API key (starts with `ntn_` or `secret_`)
3. Store in `~/.hermes/.env`:
   ```
   NOTION_API_KEY=ntn_your_key_here
   ```
4. **Share target pages/databases with the integration** in Notion: page menu `...` → `Connect to` → your integration name. Without this, the API returns 404 for that page even though it exists.

### 2. Install `ntn` (preferred path on macOS / Linux)

```bash
