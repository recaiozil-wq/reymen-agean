## Notion Workers (advanced, requires `ntn`)

Workers are TypeScript programs Notion hosts for you. One worker can expose any combination of:
- **Syncs** — pull data from external APIs into a Notion database on a schedule (default 30 min).
- **Tools** — appear as callable tools inside Notion's Custom Agents.
- **Webhooks** — receive HTTP events from external services (GitHub, Stripe, etc.) and act in Notion.

**Plan / platform gating:**
- CLI works on all plans. **Deploying Workers requires Business or Enterprise.**
- `ntn` is macOS/Linux only as of May 2026. Windows users need WSL2 or to wait for native support.
- Free through August 11, 2026; metered on Notion credits after.

### Minimal Worker

```bash
ntn workers new my-worker      # scaffold
cd my-worker
