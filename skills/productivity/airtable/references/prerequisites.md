## Prerequisites

1. Create a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** at https://airtable.com/create/tokens (tokens start with `pat...`).
2. Grant these scopes (minimum):
   - `data.records:read` — read rows
   - `data.records:write` — create / update / delete rows
   - `schema.bases:read` — list bases and tables
3. **Important:** in the same token UI, add each base you want to access to the token's **Access** list. PATs are scoped per-base — a valid token on the wrong base returns `403`.
4. Store the token in `~/.hermes/.env` (or via `hermes setup`):
   ```
   AIRTABLE_API_KEY=pat_your_token_here
   ```

> Note: legacy `key...` API keys were deprecated Feb 2024. Only PATs and OAuth tokens work now.
