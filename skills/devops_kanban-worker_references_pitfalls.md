## Pitfalls

**Task state can change between dispatch and your startup.** Between when the dispatcher claimed and when your process actually booted, the task may have been blocked, reassigned, or archived. Always `kanban_show` first. If it reports `blocked` or `archived`, stop — you shouldn't be running.

**Workspace may have stale artifacts.** Especially `dir:` and `worktree` workspaces can have files from previous runs. Read the comment thread — it usually explains why you're running again and what state the workspace is in.

**Don't rely on the CLI when the guidance is available.** The `kanban_*` tools work across all terminal backends (Docker, Modal, SSH). `hermes kanban <verb>` from your terminal tool will fail in containerized backends because the CLI isn't installed there. When in doubt, use the tool.
