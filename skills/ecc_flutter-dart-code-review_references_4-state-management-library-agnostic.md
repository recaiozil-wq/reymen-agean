## 4. State Management (Library-Agnostic)

These principles apply to all Flutter state management solutions (BLoC, Riverpod, Provider, GetX, MobX, Signals, ValueNotifier, etc.).

### Architecture:
- [ ] Business logic lives outside the widget layer — in a state management component (BLoC, Notifier, Controller, Store, ViewModel, etc.)
- [ ] State managers receive dependencies via injection, not by constructing them internally
- [ ] A service or repository layer abstracts data sources — widgets and state managers should not call APIs or databases directly
- [ ] State managers have a single responsibility — no "god" managers handling unrelated concerns
- [ ] Cross-component dependencies follow the solution's conventions:
  - In **Riverpod**: providers depending on providers via `ref.watch` is expected — flag only circular or overly tangled chains
  - In **BLoC**: blocs should not directly depend on other blocs — prefer shared repositories or presentation-layer coordination
  - In other solutions: follow the documented conventions for inter-component communication

### Immutability & value equality (for immutable-state solutions: BLoC, Riverpod, Redux):
- [ ] State objects are immutable — new instances created via `copyWith()` or constructors, never mutated in-place
- [ ] State classes implement `==` and `hashCode` properly (all fields included in comparison)
- [ ] Mechanism is consistent across the project — manual override, `Equatable`, `freezed`, Dart records, or other
- [ ] Collections inside state objects are not exposed as raw mutable `List`/`Map`

### Reactivity discipline (for reactive-mutation solutions: MobX, GetX, Signals):
- [ ] State is only mutated through the solution's reactive API (`@action` in MobX, `.value` on signals, `.obs` in GetX) — direct field mutation bypasses change tracking
- [ ] Derived values use the solution's computed mechanism rather than being stored redundantly
- [ ] Reactions and disposers are properly cleaned up (`ReactionDisposer` in MobX, effect cleanup in Signals)

### State shape design:
- [ ] Mutually exclusive states use sealed types, union variants, or the solution's built-in async state type (e.g. Riverpod's `AsyncValue`) — not boolean flags (`isLoading`, `isError`, `hasData`)
- [ ] Every async operation models loading, success, and error as distinct states
- [ ] All state variants are handled exhaustively in UI — no silently ignored cases
- [ ] Error states carry error information for display; loading states don't carry stale data
- [ ] Nullable data is not used as a loading indicator — states are explicit

```dart
// BAD — boolean flag soup allows impossible states
class UserState {
  bool isLoading = false;
  bool hasError = false; // isLoading && hasError is representable!
  User? user;
}

// GOOD (immutable approach) — sealed types make impossible states unrepresentable
sealed class UserState {}
class UserInitial extends UserState {}
class UserLoading extends UserState {}
class UserLoaded extends UserState {
  final User user;
  const UserLoaded(this.user);
}
class UserError extends UserState {
  final String message;
  const UserError(this.message);
}

// GOOD (reactive approach) — observable enum + data, mutations via reactivity API
// enum UserStatus { initial, loading, loaded, error }
// Use your solution's observable/signal to wrap status and data separately
```

### Rebuild optimization:
- [ ] State consumer widgets (Builder, Consumer, Observer, Obx, Watch, etc.) scoped as narrow as possible
- [ ] Selectors used to rebuild only when specific fields change — not on every state emission
- [ ] `const` widgets used to stop rebuild propagation through the tree
- [ ] Computed/derived state is calculated reactively, not stored redundantly

### Subscriptions & disposal:
- [ ] All manual subscriptions (`.listen()`) are cancelled in `dispose()` / `close()`
- [ ] Stream controllers are closed when no longer needed
- [ ] Timers are cancelled in disposal lifecycle
- [ ] Framework-managed lifecycle is preferred over manual subscription (declarative builders over `.listen()`)
- [ ] `mounted` check before `setState` in async callbacks
- [ ] `BuildContext` not used after `await` without checking `context.mounted` (Flutter 3.7+) — stale context causes crashes
- [ ] No navigation, dialogs, or scaffold messages after async gaps without verifying the widget is still mounted
- [ ] `BuildContext` never stored in singletons, state managers, or static fields

### Local vs global state:
- [ ] Ephemeral UI state (checkbox, slider, animation) uses local state (`setState`, `ValueNotifier`)
- [ ] Shared state is lifted only as high as needed — not over-globalized
- [ ] Feature-scoped state is properly disposed when the feature is no longer active
