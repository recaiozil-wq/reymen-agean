### Per-Project Variation Rules

Never use default configurations. For every project:
- **Custom color palette** — never raw `fill(255, 0, 0)`. Always a designed palette with 3-7 colors
- **Custom stroke weight vocabulary** — thin accents (0.5), medium structure (1-2), bold emphasis (3-5)
- **Background treatment** — never plain `background(0)` or `background(255)`. Always textured, gradient, or layered
- **Motion variety** — different speeds for different elements. Primary at 1x, secondary at 0.3x, ambient at 0.1x
- **At least one invented element** — a custom particle behavior, a novel noise application, a unique interaction response

### Project-Specific Invention

For every project, invent at least one of:
- A custom color palette matching the mood (not a preset)
- A novel noise field combination (e.g., curl noise + domain warp + feedback)
- A unique particle behavior (custom forces, custom trails, custom spawning)
- An interaction mechanic the user didn't request but that elevates the piece
- A compositional technique that creates visual hierarchy

### Parameter Design Philosophy

Parameters should emerge from the algorithm, not from a generic menu. Ask: "What properties of *this* system should be tunable?"

**Good parameters** expose the algorithm's character:
- **Quantities** — how many particles, branches, cells (controls density)
- **Scales** — noise frequency, element size, spacing (controls texture)
- **Rates** — speed, growth rate, decay (controls energy)
- **Thresholds** — when does behavior change? (controls drama)
- **Ratios** — proportions, balance between forces (controls harmony)

**Bad parameters** are generic controls unrelated to the algorithm:
- "color1", "color2", "size" — meaningless without context
- Toggle switches for unrelated effects
- Parameters that only change cosmetics, not behavior

Every parameter should change how the algorithm *thinks*, not just how it *looks*. A "turbulence" parameter that changes noise octaves is good. A "particle size" slider that only changes `ellipse()` radius is shallow.
