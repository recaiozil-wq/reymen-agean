## When To Use This Skill vs `popular-web-designs` vs `design-md`

ReYMeN has three design-related skills under `skills/creative/`. They do different jobs — load the right one (or combine them):

| Skill | What it gives you | Use when the user wants... |
|---|---|---|
| **claude-design** (this one) | Design *process and taste* — how to scope a brief, gather context, produce variants, verify a local HTML artifact, avoid AI-design slop | a from-scratch designed artifact (landing page, prototype, deck, component lab, motion study) with no specific brand or token system dictated |
| **popular-web-designs** | 54 ready-to-paste design systems — exact colors, typography, components, CSS values for sites like Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Notion, Airbnb | "make it look like Stripe / Linear / Vercel", a page styled after a known brand, or a visual starting point pulled from a real product |
| **design-md** | Google's DESIGN.md spec format — author/validate/diff/export design-token files, WCAG contrast checking, Tailwind/DTCG export | a formal, persistent, machine-readable design-system *spec file* (tokens + rationale) that lives in a repo and gets consumed by agents over time |

Rule of thumb:

- **Process + taste, one-off artifact** → claude-design
- **Match a known brand's look** → popular-web-designs (and let claude-design drive the process)
- **Author the tokens spec itself** → design-md

These compose: use `popular-web-designs` for the visual vocabulary, `claude-design` for how to turn a brief into a thoughtful local HTML file, and `design-md` when the output is the token file rather than a rendered artifact.
