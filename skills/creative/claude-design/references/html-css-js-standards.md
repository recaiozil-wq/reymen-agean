## HTML / CSS / JS Standards

Use modern CSS well:

- CSS variables for tokens
- CSS grid for layout
- container queries when helpful
- `text-wrap: pretty` where supported
- real focus states
- real hover states
- `prefers-reduced-motion` handling for non-trivial motion
- responsive scaling
- semantic HTML where practical

Avoid:

- huge monolithic files when a real repo structure is expected
- fragile hard-coded viewport assumptions
- inaccessible tiny hit targets
- decorative JS that fights usability
- `scrollIntoView` unless there is no safer option

Mobile hit targets should be at least 44px.

For print documents, text should be at least 12pt.

For 1920×1080 slide decks, text should generally be 24px or larger.
