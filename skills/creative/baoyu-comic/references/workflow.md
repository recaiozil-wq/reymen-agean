## Workflow

### Progress Checklist

```
Comic Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Setup & Analyze
  - [ ] 1.1 Analyze content
  - [ ] 1.2 Check existing directory
- [ ] Step 2: Confirmation - Style & options ⚠️ REQUIRED
- [ ] Step 3: Generate storyboard + characters
- [ ] Step 4: Review outline (conditional)
- [ ] Step 5: Generate prompts
- [ ] Step 6: Review prompts (conditional)
- [ ] Step 7: Generate images
  - [ ] 7.1 Generate character sheet (if needed) → characters/characters.png
  - [ ] 7.2 Generate pages (with character descriptions embedded in prompt)
- [ ] Step 8: Completion report
```

### Flow

```
Input → Analyze → [Check Existing?] → [Confirm: Style + Reviews] → Storyboard → [Review?] → Prompts → [Review?] → Images → Complete
```

### Step Summary

| Step | Action | Key Output |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1.1 | Analyze content | `analysis.md`, `source-{slug}.md` |
| 1.2 | Check existing directory | Handle conflicts |
| 2 | Confirm style, focus, audience, reviews | User preferences |
| 3 | Generate storyboard + characters | `storyboard.md`, `characters/` |
| 4 | Review outline (if requested) | User approval |
| 5 | Generate prompts | `prompts/*.md` |
| 6 | Review prompts (if requested) | User approval |
| 7.1 | Generate character sheet (if needed) | `characters/characters.png` |
| 7.2 | Generate pages | `*.png` files |
| 8 | Completion report | Summary |

### User Questions

Use the `clarify` tool to confirm options. Since `clarify` handles one question at a time, ask the most important question first and proceed sequentially. See [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md) for the full Step 2 question set.

**Timeout handling (CRITICAL)**: `clarify` can return `"The user did not provide a response within the time limit. Use your best judgement to make the choice and proceed."` — this is NOT user consent to default everything.

- Treat it as a default **for that one question only**. Continue asking the remaining Step 2 questions in sequence; each question is an independent consent point.
- **Surface the default to the user visibly** in your next message so they have a chance to correct it: e.g. `"Style: defaulted to ohmsha preset (clarify timed out). Say the word to switch."` — an unreported default is indistinguishable from never having asked.
- Do NOT collapse Step 2 into a single "use all defaults" pass after one timeout. If the user is genuinely absent, they will be equally absent for all five questions — but they can correct visible defaults when they return, and cannot correct invisible ones.

### Step 7: Image Generation

Use ReYMeN' built-in `image_generate` tool for all image rendering. Its schema accepts only `prompt` and `aspect_ratio` (`landscape` | `portrait` | `square`); it **returns a URL**, not a local file. Every generated page or character sheet must therefore be downloaded to the output directory.

**Prompt file requirement (hard)**: write each image's full, final prompt to a standalone file under `prompts/` (naming: `NN-{type}-[slug].md`) BEFORE calling `image_generate`. The prompt file is the reproducibility record.

**Aspect ratio mapping** — the storyboard's `aspect_ratio` field maps to `image_generate`'s format as follows:

| Storyboard ratio | `image_generate` format |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| `3:4`, `9:16`, `2:3` | `portrait` |
| `4:3`, `16:9`, `3:2` | `landscape` |
| `1:1` | `square` |

**Download step** — after every `image_generate` call:
1. Read the URL from the tool result
2. Fetch the image bytes using an **absolute** output path, e.g.
   `curl -fsSL "<url>" -o /abs/path/to/comic/<slug>/NN-page-<slug>.png`
3. Verify the file exists and is non-empty at that exact path before proceeding to the next page

**Never rely on shell CWD persistence for `-o` paths.** The terminal tool's persistent-shell CWD can change between batches (session expiry, `TERMINAL_LIFETIME_SECONDS`, a failed `cd` that leaves you in the wrong directory). `curl -o relative/path.png` is a silent footgun: if CWD has drifted, the file lands somewhere else with no error. **Always pass a fully-qualified absolute path to `-o`**, or pass `workdir=<abs path>` to the terminal tool. Incident Apr 2026: pages 06-09 of a 10-page comic landed at the repo root instead of `comic/<slug>/` because batch 3 inherited a stale CWD from batch 2 and `curl -o 06-page-skills.png` wrote to the wrong directory. The agent then spent several turns claiming the files existed where they didn't.

**7.1 Character sheet** — generate it (to `characters/characters.png`, aspect `landscape`) when the comic is multi-page with recurring characters. Skip for simple presets (e.g., four-panel minimalist) or single-page comics. The prompt file at `characters/characters.md` must exist before invoking `image_generate`. The rendered PNG is a **human-facing review artifact** (so the user can visually verify character design) and a reference for later regenerations or manual prompt edits — it does **not** drive Step 7.2. Page prompts are already written in Step 5 from the **text descriptions** in `characters/characters.md`; `image_generate` cannot accept images as visual input.

**7.2 Pages** — each page's prompt MUST already be at `prompts/NN-{cover|page}-[slug].md` before invoking `image_generate`. Because `image_generate` is prompt-only, character consistency is enforced by **embedding character descriptions (sourced from `characters/characters.md`) inline in every page prompt during Step 5**. The embedding is done uniformly whether or not a PNG sheet is produced in 7.1; the PNG is only a review/regeneration aid.

**Backup rule**: existing `prompts/…md` and `…png` files → rename with `-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` suffix before regenerating.
