# Periodic capture to check if Claude is still working or waiting for input
terminal(command="tmux capture-pane -t dev -p -S -10")
```

Look for these indicators:
- `❯` at bottom = waiting for your input (Claude is done or asking a question)
- `●` lines = Claude is actively using tools (reading, writing, running commands)
- `⏵⏵ bypass permissions on` = status bar showing permissions mode
- `◐ medium · /effort` = current effort level in status bar
- `ctrl+o to expand` = tool output was truncated (can be expanded interactively)

### Context Window Health
Use `/context` in interactive mode to see a colored grid of context usage. Key thresholds:
- **< 70%** — Normal operation, full precision
- **70-85%** — Precision starts dropping, consider `/compact`
- **> 85%** — Hallucination risk spikes significantly, use `/compact` or `/clear`
