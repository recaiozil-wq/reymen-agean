## Code Standards
- Type hints on all public functions
- Docstrings in Google style
- 2-space indentation for YAML, 4-space for Python
- No wildcard imports
```

**Be specific.** Instead of "Write good code", use "Use 2-space indentation for JS" or "Name test files with `.test.ts` suffix." Specific instructions save correction cycles.

### Rules Directory (Modular CLAUDE.md)
For projects with many rules, use the rules directory instead of one massive CLAUDE.md:
- **Project rules:** `.claude/rules/*.md` — team-shared, git-tracked
- **User rules:** `~/.claude/rules/*.md` — personal, global

Each `.md` file in the rules directory is loaded as additional context. This is cleaner than cramming everything into a single CLAUDE.md.

### Auto-Memory
Claude automatically stores learned project context in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`.
- **Limit:** 25KB or 200 lines per project
- This is separate from CLAUDE.md — it's Claude's own notes about the project, accumulated across sessions
