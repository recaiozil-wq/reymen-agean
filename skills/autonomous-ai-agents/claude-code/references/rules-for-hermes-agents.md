## Rules for ReYMeN Agents

1. **Prefer print mode (`-p`) for single tasks** — cleaner, no dialog handling, structured output
2. **Use tmux for multi-turn interactive work** — the only reliable way to orchestrate the TUI
3. **Always set `workdir`** — keep Claude focused on the right project directory
4. **Set `--max-turns` in print mode** — prevents infinite loops and runaway costs
5. **Monitor tmux sessions** — use `tmux capture-pane -t <session> -p -S -50` to check progress
6. **Look for the `❯` prompt** — indicates Claude is waiting for input (done or asking a question)
7. **Clean up tmux sessions** — kill them when done to avoid resource leaks
8. **Report results to user** — after completion, summarize what Claude did and what changed
9. **Don't kill slow sessions** — Claude may be doing multi-step work; check progress instead
10. **Use `--allowedTools`** — restrict capabilities to what the task actually needs
