# Browser-Based Agent Setup

## When to Use
- Setting up a web-based AI agent platform (Creo AI, similar services)
- Need to automate clicks, form fills, and navigation through a browser
- Need to maintain login state across automation sessions
- Configuring agents, connectors, schedules, and prompts automatically
- User prefers full autonomous execution over step-by-step instructions

## Prerequisites
- Playwright: `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`
- Google Chrome installed
- Target platform URL and valid login
- Windows: Chrome user data path: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data`

## Workflow

### 1. Launch Browser with Persistent Profile
Use `launch_persistent_context`, NOT `browser_type.launch` with `--user-data-dir`.
**Critical:** Close all Chrome windows first to avoid profile lock.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
import time

user_data = r"C:\Users\marko\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data"
with sync_playwright() as p:
    context = p.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
        user_data_dir=user_data,
        headless=False,
        executable_path=r"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe",
        args=["--profile-directory=Default", "--start-maximized"],
        viewport={"width": 1920, "height": 1080}
    )
    page = context.new_page()
```

### 2. Navigate and Assess State
- `page.goto(url, wait_until="domcontentloaded", timeout=120000)`
- `page.screenshot(path=...)` after load
- Analyze screenshot to identify UI state (login, dashboard, etc.)

### 3. Authenticate
- If login page: fill credentials and submit
- If SSO button present: click it
- Wait for dashboard elements to confirm login
- If 2FA/captcha: pause and inform user

### 4. Configure Platform (Generic Pattern)
Most platforms share this flow:
1. Connect services (Connectors / Integrations)
2. Create or select an agent/chat
3. Select model
4. Paste prompt into chat input
5. Submit and wait for agent response
6. Configure schedule/repeat
7. Test with “Run now”

**Prompt formatting:** Use clear numbered bullets. For draft-only tasks, explicitly state “do not send”.

### 5. Set Schedule
- Locate schedule/scheduler control
- Set repeat interval, time, timezone, recipient email
- Confirm submission

### 6. Test and Verify
- Use platform’s “Run now” / manual trigger
- Check outputs: emails sent, files created, social posts

### 7. Report Results
- Screenshot final state
- List completed steps vs. any manual actions still required
- Provide data handles (IDs, URLs, file paths) where applicable

## Pitfalls

### Chrome Profile Lock
- **Symptom:** `TargetClosedError` on launch
- **Cause:** Chrome is open and holding the profile
- **Fix:** Close all Chrome windows, or use a separate profile directory (`--profile-directory=Profile 1`)
- **Rule:** `launch_persistent_context` is required. Never pass `--user-data-dir` via `args` in `browser_type.launch`.

### Dynamic Content Loading
- **Problem:** UI elements appear slowly
- **Fix:** Use `wait_until` with specific selectors, not fixed sleeps
- **Fallback:** Screenshot + coordinate-based click when selectors fail

### Credential Handling
- **Never** hardcode credentials
- Load from user environment, prompt, or secure store
- Mask passwords in logs and screenshots

### Platform Variations
Each platform has different DOM structure. When selectors fail:
1. Use `get_by_role` / `get_by_text` for accessibility-first locating
2. Fall back to CSS selectors
3. Last resort: coordinate-based mouse click (if heredity allows)

## User Preferences
- Autonomous execution is preferred over explanatory instructions
- When a skill is loaded, perform the steps rather than describe them
- Report outcomes after completion; avoid pre-emptive narration
- Do not retry failed steps excessively without user consent
