## When to Use

- A Node test fails and you need to see intermediate state
- ui-tui crashes or behaves wrong and you want to inspect React/Ink state pre-render
- tui_gateway child processes (`_SlashWorker`, PTY bridge workers) misbehave
- You need to inspect a value in a closure that `console.log` can't reach without patching
- Perf: attach to a running process to capture a CPU profile or heap snapshot

**Don't use for:** things `console.log` solves in under a minute. Breakpoint-driven debugging is heavier; use it when the payoff is real.
