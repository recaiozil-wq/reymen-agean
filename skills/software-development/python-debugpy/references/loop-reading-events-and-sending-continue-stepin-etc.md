# ... loop reading events and sending continue/stepIn/etc.

This is fine for one-off automation but painful as an interactive UX.

**Option 2: Attach from VS Code / Cursor / Zed** — if the user has one open, they can add a `launch.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Attach to ReYMeN",
  "type": "debugpy",
  "request": "attach",
  "connect": { "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 5678 },
  "justMyCode": false,
  "pathMappings": [
    { "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}", "remoteRoot": "/home/bb/hermes-agent" }
  ]
}
```

**Option 3: Ditch DAP, use `remote-pdb`** — usually what you actually want from a terminal agent:

```bash
pip install remote-pdb
```

In your code:
```python
from remote_pdb import set_trace
set_trace(host="127.0.0.1", port=4444)   # blocks until connection
```

Then from the terminal:
```bash
nc 127.0.0.1 4444
