## When to Use

- Building new features where long-term maintainability and testability matter.
- Refactoring layered or framework-heavy code where domain logic is mixed with I/O concerns.
- Supporting multiple interfaces for the same use case (HTTP, CLI, queue workers, cron jobs).
- Replacing infrastructure (database, external APIs, message bus) without rewriting business rules.

Use this skill when the request involves boundaries, domain-centric design, refactoring tightly coupled services, or decoupling application logic from specific libraries.
