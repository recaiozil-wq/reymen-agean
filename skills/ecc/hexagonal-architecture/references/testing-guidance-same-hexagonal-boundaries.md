## Testing Guidance (Same Hexagonal Boundaries)

- **Domain tests**: test entities/value objects as pure business rules (no mocks, no framework setup).
- **Use-case unit tests**: test orchestration with fakes/stubs for outbound ports; assert business outcomes and port interactions.
- **Outbound adapter contract tests**: define shared contract suites at port level and run them against each adapter implementation.
- **Inbound adapter tests**: verify protocol mapping (HTTP/CLI/queue payload to use-case input and output/error mapping back to protocol).
- **Adapter integration tests**: run against real infrastructure (DB/API/queue) for serialization, schema/query behavior, retries, and timeouts.
- **End-to-end tests**: cover critical user journeys through inbound adapter -> use case -> outbound adapter.
- **Refactor safety**: add characterization tests before extraction; keep them until new boundary behavior is stable and equivalent.
