## Quick Reference Checklist

Before marking C++ work complete:

- [ ] No raw `new`/`delete` -- use smart pointers or RAII (R.11)
- [ ] Objects initialized at declaration (ES.20)
- [ ] Variables are `const`/`constexpr` by default (Con.1, ES.25)
- [ ] Member functions are `const` where possible (Con.2)
- [ ] `enum class` instead of plain `enum` (Enum.3)
- [ ] `nullptr` instead of `0`/`NULL` (ES.47)
- [ ] No narrowing conversions (ES.46)
- [ ] No C-style casts (ES.48)
- [ ] Single-argument constructors are `explicit` (C.46)
- [ ] Rule of Zero or Rule of Five applied (C.20, C.21)
- [ ] Base class destructors are public virtual or protected non-virtual (C.35)
- [ ] Templates are constrained with concepts (T.10)
- [ ] No `using namespace` in headers at global scope (SF.7)
- [ ] Headers have include guards and are self-contained (SF.8, SF.11)
- [ ] Locks use RAII (`scoped_lock`/`lock_guard`) (CP.20)
- [ ] Exceptions are custom types, thrown by value, caught by reference (E.14, E.15)
- [ ] `'\n'` instead of `std::endl` (SL.io.50)
- [ ] No magic numbers (ES.45)
