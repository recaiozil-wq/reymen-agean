## Philosophy & Interfaces (P.*, I.*)

### Key Rules

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| **P.1** | Express ideas directly in code |
| **P.3** | Express intent |
| **P.4** | Ideally, a program should be statically type safe |
| **P.5** | Prefer compile-time checking to run-time checking |
| **P.8** | Don't leak any resources |
| **P.10** | Prefer immutable data to mutable data |
| **I.1** | Make interfaces explicit |
| **I.2** | Avoid non-const global variables |
| **I.4** | Make interfaces precisely and strongly typed |
| **I.11** | Never transfer ownership by a raw pointer or reference |
| **I.23** | Keep the number of function arguments low |

### DO

```cpp
// P.10 + I.4: Immutable, strongly typed interface
struct Temperature {
    double kelvin;
};

Temperature boil(const Temperature& water);
```

### DON'T

```cpp
// Weak interface: unclear ownership, unclear units
double boil(double* temp);

// Non-const global variable
int g_counter = 0;  // I.2 violation
```
