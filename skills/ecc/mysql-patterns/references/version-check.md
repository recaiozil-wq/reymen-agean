## Version Check

Start by identifying the engine and version:

```sql
SELECT VERSION();
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'version_comment';
```

Keep MySQL and MariaDB guidance separate when syntax differs:

- MySQL documents row aliases as the replacement for `VALUES(col)` in
  `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`; `VALUES(col)` is deprecated there.
- MariaDB documents `VALUES(col)` as the supported way to reference inserted
  values in `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`; use it for cross-engine compatibility.
- `SKIP LOCKED` is appropriate for queue-like work only. It skips locked rows
  and can return an inconsistent view, so do not use it for general accounting
  or integrity-sensitive reads.
