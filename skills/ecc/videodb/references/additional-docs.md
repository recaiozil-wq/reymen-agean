**Do not use ffmpeg, moviepy, or local encoding tools** when VideoDB supports the operation. The following are all handled server-side by VideoDB — trimming, combining clips, overlaying audio or music, adding subtitles, text/image overlays, transcoding, resolution changes, aspect-ratio conversion, resizing for platform requirements, transcription, and media generation. Only fall back to local tools for operations listed under Limitations in reference/editor.md (transitions, speed changes, crop/zoom, colour grading, volume mixing).

### When to use what

| Problem | VideoDB solution |
|---------|-----------------|
| Platform rejects video aspect ratio or resolution | `video.reframe()` or `conn.transcode()` with `VideoConfig` |
| Need to resize video for Twitter/Instagram/TikTok | `video.reframe(target="vertical")` or `target="square"` |
| Need to change resolution (e.g. 1080p → 720p) | `conn.transcode()` with `VideoConfig(resolution=720)` |
| Need to overlay audio/music on video | `AudioAsset` on a `Timeline` |
| Need to add subtitles | `video.add_subtitle()` or `CaptionAsset` |
| Need to combine/trim clips | `VideoAsset` on a `Timeline` |
| Need to generate voiceover, music, or SFX | `coll.generate_voice()`, `generate_music()`, `generate_sound_effect()` |
