## Creating New Projects

If no guidelines are provided by the user, use these defaults when creating a new Angular project:

1. Use the latest stable version of Angular unless the user specifies otherwise.
2. Prefer Signal Forms for new projects only when the target Angular version supports them. [Find out more](references/signal-forms.md).

**Execution Rules for `ng new`:**
When asked to create a new Angular project, you must determine the correct execution command by following these strict steps:

**Step 1: Check for an explicit user version.**

- **IF** the user requests a specific version (e.g., Angular 15), bypass local installations and strictly use `npx`.
- **Command:** `npx @angular/cli@<requested_version> new <project-name>`

**Step 2: Check for an existing Angular installation.**

- **IF** no specific version is requested, run `ng version` in the terminal to check if the Angular CLI is already installed on the system.
- **IF** the command succeeds and returns an installed version, use the local/global installation directly.
- **Command:** `ng new <project-name>`

**Step 3: Fallback to Latest.**

- **IF** no specific version is requested AND the `ng version` command fails (indicating no Angular installation exists), you must use `npx` to fetch the latest version.
- **Command:** `npx @angular/cli@latest new <project-name>`
