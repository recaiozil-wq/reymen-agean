## Choosing the Right Pattern

### Decision Matrix

```
Is the task a single focused change?
├─ Yes → Sequential Pipeline or NanoClaw
└─ No → Is there a written spec/RFC?
         ├─ Yes → Do you need parallel implementation?
         │        ├─ Yes → Ralphinho (DAG orchestration)
         │        └─ No → Continuous Claude (iterative PR loop)
         └─ No → Do you need many variations of the same thing?
                  ├─ Yes → Infinite Agentic Loop (spec-driven generation)
                  └─ No → Sequential Pipeline with de-sloppify
```

### Combining Patterns

These patterns compose well:

1. **Sequential Pipeline + De-Sloppify** — The most common combination. Every implement step gets a cleanup pass.

2. **Continuous Claude + De-Sloppify** — Add `--review-prompt` with a de-sloppify directive to each iteration.

3. **Any loop + Verification** — Use ECC's `/verify` command or `verification-loop` skill as a gate before commits.

4. **Ralphinho's tiered approach in simpler loops** — Even in a sequential pipeline, you can route simple tasks to Haiku and complex tasks to Opus:
   ```bash
