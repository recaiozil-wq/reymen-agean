## Core Principles

### 1. Tests BEFORE Code
ALWAYS write tests first, then implement code to make tests pass.

### 2. Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% coverage (unit + integration + E2E)
- All edge cases covered
- Error scenarios tested
- Boundary conditions verified

### 3. Test Types

#### Unit Tests
- Individual functions and utilities
- Component logic
- Pure functions
- Helpers and utilities

#### Integration Tests
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- Service interactions
- External API calls

#### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Critical user flows
- Complete workflows
- Browser automation
- UI interactions

### 4. Git Checkpoints
- If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit after each TDD stage
- Do not squash or rewrite these checkpoint commits until the workflow is complete
- Each checkpoint commit message must describe the stage and the exact evidence captured
- Count only commits created on the current active branch for the current task
- Do not treat commits from other branches, earlier unrelated work, or distant branch history as valid checkpoint evidence
- Before treating a checkpoint as satisfied, verify that the commit is reachable from the current `HEAD` on the active branch and belongs to the current task sequence
- The preferred compact workflow is:
  - one commit for failing test added and RED validated
  - one commit for minimal fix applied and GREEN validated
  - one optional commit for refactor complete
- Separate evidence-only commits are not required if the test commit clearly corresponds to RED and the fix commit clearly corresponds to GREEN
