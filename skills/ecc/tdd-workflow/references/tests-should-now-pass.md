# Tests should now pass
```

Rerun the same relevant test target after the fix and confirm the previously failing test is now GREEN.

Only after a valid GREEN result may you proceed to refactor.

If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit immediately after GREEN is validated.
Recommended commit message format:
- `fix: <feature or bug>`
- The fix commit may also serve as the GREEN validation checkpoint if the same relevant test target was rerun and passed
- Verify that this checkpoint commit is on the current active branch before continuing

### Step 6: Refactor
Improve code quality while keeping tests green:
- Remove duplication
- Improve naming
- Optimize performance
- Enhance readability

If the repository is under Git, create a checkpoint commit immediately after refactoring is complete and tests remain green.
Recommended commit message format:
- `refactor: clean up after <feature or bug> implementation`
- Verify that this checkpoint commit is on the current active branch before considering the TDD cycle complete

### Step 7: Verify Coverage
```bash
npm run test:coverage
