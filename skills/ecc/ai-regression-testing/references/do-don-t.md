## DO / DON'T

**DO:**
- Write tests immediately after finding a bug (before fixing it if possible)
- Test the API response shape, not the implementation
- Run tests as the first step of every bug-check
- Keep tests fast (< 1 second total with sandbox mode)
- Name tests after the bug they prevent (e.g., "BUG-R1 regression")

**DON'T:**
- Write tests for code that has never had a bug
- Trust AI self-review as a substitute for automated tests
- Skip sandbox path testing because "it's just mock data"
- Write integration tests when unit tests suffice
- Aim for coverage percentage — aim for regression prevention
