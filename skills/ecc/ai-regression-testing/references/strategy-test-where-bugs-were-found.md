## Strategy: Test Where Bugs Were Found

Don't aim for 100% coverage. Instead:

```
Bug found in /api/user/profile     → Write test for profile API
Bug found in /api/user/messages    → Write test for messages API
Bug found in /api/user/favorites   → Write test for favorites API
No bug in /api/user/notifications  → Don't write test (yet)
```

**Why this works with AI development:**

1. AI tends to make the **same category of mistake** repeatedly
2. Bugs cluster in complex areas (auth, multi-path logic, state management)
3. Once tested, that exact regression **cannot happen again**
4. Test count grows organically with bug fixes — no wasted effort
