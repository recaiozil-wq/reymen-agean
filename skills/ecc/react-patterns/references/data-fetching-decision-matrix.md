## Data Fetching Decision Matrix

| Need | Tool |
|---|---|
| Per-request data in Next.js App Router | RSC `await fetch()` |
| Client-side cache + mutations + invalidation | TanStack Query |
| Lightweight client cache + revalidation | SWR |
| Real-time subscriptions | Server-Sent Events, WebSockets, or the lib's subscription API |
| One-off fire-and-forget | `fetch()` in an event handler |

Avoid `useEffect` + `fetch` for application data — race conditions, no cache, no retry, no Suspense integration.
