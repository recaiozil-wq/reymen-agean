## Performance

### When `React.memo` Actually Helps

Wrap a component in `React.memo` only when:

1. It re-renders frequently
2. Its props are usually the same between renders
3. Its render is measurably expensive

`React.memo` adds an equality check on every render. If props differ on most renders, the check is pure overhead.

### Avoiding Render Cascades

- Lift state down rather than up where possible
- Split context: one context per concern, so a change to `themeContext` does not re-render auth consumers
- Use `useSyncExternalStore` for external state libraries — required for safe concurrent rendering

### Lists

- Provide stable `key` props (database id, not array index)
- Virtualize long lists with `@tanstack/react-virtual` or `react-window` once visible item count exceeds ~50 with non-trivial rows
