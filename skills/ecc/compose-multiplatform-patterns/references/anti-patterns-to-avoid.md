## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Using `mutableStateOf` in ViewModels when `MutableStateFlow` with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` is safer for lifecycle
- Passing `NavController` deep into composables — pass lambda callbacks instead
- Heavy computation inside `@Composable` functions — move to ViewModel or `remember {}`
- Using `LaunchedEffect(Unit)` as a substitute for ViewModel init — it re-runs on configuration change in some setups
- Creating new object instances in composable parameters — causes unnecessary recomposition
