## Anti-Patterns

- `container.querySelector("...")` — bypasses accessibility queries, lets tests pass when real users would fail
- Asserting on number of renders — implementation detail
- `jest.mock("react", ...)` — never mock React. Refactor the component instead
- Mocking child components by default — tests the integration, not isolation. Mock only when the child has heavy side effects
- Ignoring `act()` warnings — they signal real bugs (state update after unmount, missing async wrapping)
- Sharing mutable state across tests — flakes when test order changes
- Tests that pass with `it.skip()` removed — your test does not actually assert what you think
