## When NOT to Use Snapshot Tests

Snapshots of rendered output:

- Break on every styling change
- Get rubber-stamped during review
- Test implementation detail (DOM structure), not behavior

Acceptable snapshot uses:

- Pure data serialization functions (`formatInvoice(invoice)` -> stable string)
- Generated config files (e.g., webpack config output)

For visual regression on components, use Playwright/Cypress screenshots or Percy/Chromatic — actual visual diffs, not DOM strings.
