## How WireGuard Works

```
Your phone (WireGuard client)
    │
    │  Encrypted UDP tunnel (port 51820)
    │
Your home router (WireGuard server — needs a public IP or DDNS)
    │
    Your home network (192.168.1.0/24, NAS, Pi, etc.)

Every device has a keypair (public + private key).
The server knows each client's public key.
The client knows the server's public key + endpoint (IP:port).
Traffic is encrypted end-to-end with no central server or certificate authority.
