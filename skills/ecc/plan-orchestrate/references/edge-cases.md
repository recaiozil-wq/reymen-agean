## Edge cases

- **No clear steps**: prefer H2/H3 splitting; if still ambiguous, report "no structured steps detected" with the document outline and ask the user to confirm running by outline.
- **Large plan (>1500 lines)**: enter **overview-only mode** — emit only the overview table and ask the user to narrow with `--scope` before re-running for details. In this mode, skip per-step detail blocks and skip the Batch execution block.
- **Step too broad** (e.g. "complete all backend work"): do not force a single chain. Suggest splitting into N.a and N.b and propose a split.
- **Plan declares agents** (rare): first **strip any `everything-claude-code:` prefix** to get the bare catalogue name (Phase 0 step 5), then validate against the catalogue. Replace invalid agents and explain under "Chain rationale". The bare name is re-prefixed at output time per `ECC_MODE`.
- **Polyglot project where `--lang=auto` cannot pick a winner**: set `lang=unknown`; reviewer resolves to `code-reviewer` and build resolver to `build-error-resolver`. Mention the fallback under "Chain rationale".
