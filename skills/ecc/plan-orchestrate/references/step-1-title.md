## Step 1 — <title>

**Intent**: <1–3 sentences>
**Tags**: <a, b>
**Chain rationale**: <why this chain; which agent closes the loop>

```bash
{ORCH_CMD} custom "{AGENT(tdd-guide)},{AGENT(database-reviewer)},{AGENT(python-reviewer)}" "[Plan: docs/foo.md#step-1] <compressed task description>; Acceptance: <1–3 items>; Out of scope: <…>"
```
````

> The `{ORCH_CMD}` and `{AGENT(...)}` notation above describes the substitution this skill performs at runtime. The actual emitted Markdown contains the resolved strings, never the placeholders.

Append a final "Batch execution" block aggregating every step's command in order so the user can paste them all at once. **Skip the Batch block in overview-only mode** (see "Large plan" edge case): when only the overview table is being emitted, there are no per-step commands to aggregate.

### Phase 5 — Self-check (run before emitting)

- [ ] Every agent in every chain comes from the catalogue (after stripping any `everything-claude-code:` prefix that appeared in the plan; see Phase 0 step 5).
- [ ] Resolved `{ORCH_CMD}` and every resolved `{AGENT(...)}` use the **same** form (`plugin` or `legacy`) — never mixed in one output.
- [ ] No `# plugin form` / `# legacy form` annotations and no "strip the prefix" instructions remain in the rendered output.
- [ ] No invented `--mode` / `--gate` / `--agents=...` fields.
- [ ] Each task description is single-line, double-quoted, with embedded `"` escaped.
- [ ] Each task description begins with `[Plan: <path>#step-<id>]` and includes Acceptance (1–3 items). The `Out of scope:` clause is present only when inherited from the plan.
- [ ] No duplicate agent in any chain after Phase 2 dedup.
- [ ] Chain length ≤ 4.
- [ ] Steps tagged `impl`/`refactor`/`migration` end with a reviewer-class agent (`<lang>-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, or `database-reviewer`). `test` and `build` are exempt — see Phase 2 rule 10.
- [ ] Zero-tag steps emit `code-reviewer` with the rationale `no tag matched; default review-only chain`.
- [ ] Overview table lists every step in the plan, regardless of `--scope`.
- [ ] Per-step detail block count matches the resolved `--scope` (full plan when `--scope=all`; one block for `step:n`; range size for `range:a-b`). In overview-only mode, no per-step blocks and no Batch block are emitted.
