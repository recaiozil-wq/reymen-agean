## When to Activate

- User has a multi-step plan document (PRD, RFC, implementation plan) and wants to drive it through `/orchestrate`.
- User says "orchestrate this plan", "give me orchestrate prompts for each step", "compose chains for this plan".
- A step-by-step plan exists but the user does not want to manually pick agents per step.

Skip when:
- The work is one ad-hoc step → call `/orchestrate custom` directly.
- The plan is unreadable or empty. Lack of explicit numbering alone is not a skip condition — see the "No clear steps" edge case below.
