## How It Works

Exposed provides two query styles: DSL for direct SQL-like expressions and DAO for entity lifecycle management. HikariCP manages a pool of reusable database connections configured via `HikariConfig`. Flyway runs versioned SQL migration scripts at startup to keep the schema in sync. All database operations run inside `newSuspendedTransaction` blocks for coroutine safety and atomicity. The repository pattern wraps Exposed queries behind an interface so business logic stays decoupled from the data layer and tests can use an in-memory H2 database.
