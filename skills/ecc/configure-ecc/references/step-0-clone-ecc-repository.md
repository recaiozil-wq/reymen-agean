## Step 0: Clone ECC Repository

Before any installation, clone the latest ECC source to `/tmp`:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/everything-claude-code
git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git /tmp/everything-claude-code
```

Set `ECC_ROOT=/tmp/everything-claude-code` as the source for all subsequent copy operations.

If the clone fails (network issues, etc.), use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user to provide a local path to an existing ECC clone.
