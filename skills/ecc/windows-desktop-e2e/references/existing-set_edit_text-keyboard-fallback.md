# ... existing set_edit_text / keyboard fallback ...

### Caveats

- **PII / credentials**: `type_text` content is `<redacted>` by default. Never set `E2E_TRACE_INCLUDE_TEXT=1` on login or payment flows.
- **Overhead**: ~50–200ms per action + one PNG per step on disk. Don't enable on the default CI matrix — only on a dedicated flake-repro job.
- **Artifact bloat**: a long flow produces tens of MB; tune `retention-days` accordingly.
- **Parallel/rerun hygiene**: this simple example appends to `trace.jsonl` and uses a class-level counter. Clear the artifact directory before reruns, and use per-worker artifact dirs for parallel tests.
- **Coverage gap**: actions performed outside `BasePage` (raw `pywinauto` calls in test code) are not traced.
