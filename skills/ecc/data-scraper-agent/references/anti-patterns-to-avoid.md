## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| One LLM call per item | Hits rate limits instantly | Batch 5 items per call |
| Hardcoded keywords in code | Not reusable | Move all config to `config.yaml` |
| Scraping without rate limit | IP ban | Add `time.sleep(1)` between requests |
| Storing secrets in code | Security risk | Always use `.env` + GitHub Secrets |
| No deduplication | Duplicate rows pile up | Always check URL before pushing |
| Ignoring `robots.txt` | Legal/ethical risk | Respect crawl rules; use public APIs when available |
| JS-rendered sites with `requests` | Empty response | Use Playwright or look for the underlying API |
| `maxOutputTokens` too low | Truncated JSON, parse error | Use 2048+ for batch responses |
