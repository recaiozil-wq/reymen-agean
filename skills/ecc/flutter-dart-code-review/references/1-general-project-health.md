## 1. General Project Health

- [ ] Project follows consistent folder structure (feature-first or layer-first)
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns: UI, business logic, data layers
- [ ] No business logic in widgets; widgets are purely presentational
- [ ] `pubspec.yaml` is clean — no unused dependencies, versions pinned appropriately
- [ ] `analysis_options.yaml` includes a strict lint set with strict analyzer settings enabled
- [ ] No `print()` statements in production code — use `dart:developer` `log()` or a logging package
- [ ] Generated files (`.g.dart`, `.freezed.dart`, `.gr.dart`) are up-to-date or in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Platform-specific code isolated behind abstractions
