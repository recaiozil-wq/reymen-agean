## 9. Security

### Secure storage:
- [ ] Sensitive data (tokens, credentials) stored using platform-secure storage (Keychain on iOS, EncryptedSharedPreferences on Android)
- [ ] Never store secrets in plaintext storage
- [ ] Biometric authentication gating considered for sensitive operations

### API key handling:
- [ ] API keys NOT hardcoded in Dart source — use `--dart-define`, `.env` files excluded from VCS, or compile-time configuration
- [ ] Secrets not committed to git — check `.gitignore`
- [ ] Backend proxy used for truly secret keys (client should never hold server secrets)

### Input validation:
- [ ] All user input validated before sending to API
- [ ] Form validation uses proper validation patterns
- [ ] No raw SQL or string interpolation of user input
- [ ] Deep link URLs validated and sanitized before navigation

### Network security:
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all API calls
- [ ] Certificate pinning considered for high-security apps
- [ ] Authentication tokens refreshed and expired properly
- [ ] No sensitive data logged or printed
