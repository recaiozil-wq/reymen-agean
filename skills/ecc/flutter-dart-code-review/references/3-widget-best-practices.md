## 3. Widget Best Practices

### Widget decomposition:
- [ ] No single widget with a `build()` method exceeding ~80-100 lines
- [ ] Widgets split by encapsulation AND by how they change (rebuild boundaries)
- [ ] Private `_build*()` helper methods that return widgets are extracted to separate widget classes (enables element reuse, const propagation, and framework optimizations)
- [ ] Stateless widgets preferred over Stateful where no mutable local state is needed
- [ ] Extracted widgets are in separate files when reusable

### Const usage:
- [ ] `const` constructors used wherever possible — prevents unnecessary rebuilds
- [ ] `const` literals for collections that don't change (`const []`, `const {}`)
- [ ] Constructor is declared `const` when all fields are final

### Key usage:
- [ ] `ValueKey` used in lists/grids to preserve state across reorders
- [ ] `GlobalKey` used sparingly — only when accessing state across the tree is truly needed
- [ ] `UniqueKey` avoided in `build()` — it forces rebuild every frame
- [ ] `ObjectKey` used when identity is based on a data object rather than a single value

### Theming & design system:
- [ ] Colors come from `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` — no hardcoded `Colors.red` or hex values
- [ ] Text styles come from `Theme.of(context).textTheme` — no inline `TextStyle` with raw font sizes
- [ ] Dark mode compatibility verified — no assumptions about light background
- [ ] Spacing and sizing use consistent design tokens or constants, not magic numbers

### Build method complexity:
- [ ] No network calls, file I/O, or heavy computation in `build()`
- [ ] No `Future.then()` or `async` work in `build()`
- [ ] No subscription creation (`.listen()`) in `build()`
- [ ] `setState()` localized to smallest possible subtree
