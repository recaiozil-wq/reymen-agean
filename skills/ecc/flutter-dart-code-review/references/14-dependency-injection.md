## 14. Dependency Injection

### Principles (apply to any DI approach):
- [ ] Classes depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations at layer boundaries
- [ ] Dependencies provided externally via constructor, DI framework, or provider graph — not created internally
- [ ] Registration distinguishes lifetime: singleton vs factory vs lazy singleton
- [ ] Environment-specific bindings (dev/staging/prod) use configuration, not runtime `if` checks
- [ ] No circular dependencies in the DI graph
- [ ] Service locator calls (if used) are not scattered throughout business logic
