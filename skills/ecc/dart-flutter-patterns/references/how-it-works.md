## How It Works

This skill provides copy-paste-ready Dart/Flutter code patterns organized by concern:
1. **Null safety** — avoid `!`, prefer `?.`/`??`/pattern matching
2. **Immutable state** — sealed classes, `freezed`, `copyWith`
3. **Async composition** — concurrent `Future.wait`, safe `BuildContext` after `await`
4. **Widget architecture** — extract to classes (not methods), `const` propagation, scoped rebuilds
5. **State management** — BLoC/Cubit events, Riverpod notifiers and derived providers
6. **Navigation** — GoRouter with reactive auth guards via `refreshListenable`
7. **Networking** — Dio with interceptors, token refresh with one-time retry guard
8. **Error handling** — global capture, `ErrorWidget.builder`, crashlytics wiring
9. **Testing** — unit (BLoC test), widget (ProviderScope overrides), fakes over mocks
