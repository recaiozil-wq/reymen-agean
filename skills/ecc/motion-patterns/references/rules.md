## Rules

1. **Always wrap conditional renders in `AnimatePresence` with a `key`** on the direct child. Without a key, exit animations never fire.
2. **Always define `exit` when defining `initial` + `animate`.** An animation without an exit is incomplete.
3. **Use `mode="wait"` on page transitions.** Enter must not start until exit completes.
4. **Never use `layout` on subtrees with more than ~5 children or deeply nested DOM.** Use explicit `x`/`y` transforms instead.
5. **Stagger interval must stay between `0.05s` and `0.10s`.** Below feels mechanical; above feels sluggish.
6. **Modals must always include:** focus trap, Escape-key close, scroll lock, `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`.
7. **Scroll reveals use `viewport={{ once: true }}`.** Repeating on scroll-out is distracting, not informative.
8. **All token values are imported from `motion-foundations`.** No inline numbers.
