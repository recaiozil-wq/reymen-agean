## Decision Guidance

### Choosing the right pattern

| Situation | Pattern |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Element appears / disappears             | `AnimatePresence`      |
| List of items loading in sequence        | Stagger variants       |
| Navigating between routes                | Page transition wrapper|
| Element changes size in place            | `layout` prop          |
| Same element moves across page contexts  | `layoutId`             |
| Element enters when scrolled into view   | `whileInView`          |
| Value tied to scroll position            | `useScroll` + `useTransform` |

### When to use `mode="wait"` vs `mode="sync"`

| Mode | Use when |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `wait` | Page transitions, content swaps (one at a time) |
| `sync` | Stacked notifications, list items (overlap is fine) |
| `popLayout` | Items removed from a reflow list |
