### TTL Strategy

| Data Type | Suggested TTL |
|-----------|--------------|
| User session | 24h (`86400`) |
| API response cache | 5–15 min |
| Rate limit window | Match window size |
| Short-lived tokens | 5–10 min |
| Leaderboard | 1h–24h |
| Static/reference data | 1h–1 week |

Always set a TTL. Keys without TTL accumulate indefinitely and cause memory pressure.
