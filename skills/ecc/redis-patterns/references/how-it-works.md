## How It Works

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that supports strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams, and more. Individual Redis commands are atomic on a single instance; multi-step workflows require Lua scripts, MULTI/EXEC transactions, or explicit synchronization to stay atomic. Data is optionally persisted via RDB snapshots or AOF logs. Clients communicate over TCP using the RESP protocol; connection pools are essential to avoid per-request handshake overhead.
