## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Keys with no TTL | Memory grows unbounded | Always set TTL |
| `KEYS *` in production | Blocks the server (O(N)) | Use `SCAN` cursor |
| Storing large blobs (>100KB) | Slow serialization, memory pressure | Store reference + fetch from object store |
| Single Redis for everything | No isolation between cache & queue | Use separate DBs or instances |
| Ignoring connection pool limits | Connection exhaustion under load | Size pool to workload |
| Not handling cache miss stampede | Thundering herd on cold start | Use locks or probabilistic early expiry |
| `FLUSHALL` without thought | Wipes entire instance | Scope deletes by key pattern |

### Cache Miss Stampede Prevention

```python
import threading

_locks: dict[str, threading.Lock] = {}
_locks_mutex = threading.Lock()

def get_with_lock(key: str, fetch_fn, ttl: int = 300):
    cached = r.get(key)
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)

    with _locks_mutex:
        if key not in _locks:
            _locks[key] = threading.Lock()
        lock = _locks[key]
    with lock:
        cached = r.get(key)  # Re-check after acquiring lock
        if cached:
            return json.loads(cached)
        value = fetch_fn()
        r.setex(key, ttl, json.dumps(value))
        return value
```

> Note: for multi-process deployments, replace the in-process lock with `acquire_lock`/`release_lock` from the Distributed Locks section above.
