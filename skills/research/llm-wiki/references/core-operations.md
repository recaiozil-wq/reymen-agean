## Core Operations

### 1. Ingest

When the user provides a source (URL, file, paste), integrate it into the wiki:

① **Capture the raw source:**
   - URL → use `web_extract` to get markdown, save to `raw/articles/`
   - PDF → use `web_extract` (handles PDFs), save to `raw/papers/`
   - Pasted text → save to appropriate `raw/` subdirectory
   - Name the file descriptively: `raw/articles/karpathy-llm-wiki-2026.md`
   - **Add raw frontmatter** (`source_url`, `ingested`, `sha256` of the body).
     On re-ingest of the same URL: recompute the sha256, compare to the stored value —
     skip if identical, flag drift and update if different. This is cheap enough to
     do on every re-ingest and catches silent source changes.

② **Discuss takeaways** with the user — what's interesting, what matters for
   the domain. (Skip this in automated/cron contexts — proceed directly.)

③ **Check what already exists** — search index.md and use `search_files` to find
   existing pages for mentioned entities/concepts. This is the difference between
   a growing wiki and a pile of duplicates.

④ **Write or update wiki pages:**
   - **New entities/concepts:** Create pages only if they meet the Page Thresholds
     in SCHEMA.md (2+ source mentions, or central to one source)
   - **Existing pages:** Add new information, update facts, bump `updated` date.
     When new info contradicts existing content, follow the Update Policy.
   - **Cross-reference:** Every new or updated page must link to at least 2 other
     pages via `[[wikilinks]]`. Check that existing pages link back.
   - **Tags:** Only use tags from the taxonomy in SCHEMA.md
   - **Provenance:** On pages synthesizing 3+ sources, append `^[raw/articles/source.md]`
     markers to paragraphs whose claims trace to a specific source.
   - **Confidence:** For opinion-heavy, fast-moving, or single-source claims, set
     `confidence: medium` or `low` in frontmatter. Don't mark `high` unless the
     claim is well-supported across multiple sources.

⑤ **Update navigation:**
   - Add new pages to `index.md` under the correct section, alphabetically
   - Update the "Total pages" count and "Last updated" date in index header
   - Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Source Title`
   - List every file created or updated in the log entry

⑥ **Report what changed** — list every file created or updated to the user.

A single source can trigger updates across 5-15 wiki pages. This is normal
and desired — it's the compounding effect.

### 2. Query

When the user asks a question about the wiki's domain:

① **Read `index.md`** to identify relevant pages.
② **For wikis with 100+ pages**, also `search_files` across all `.md` files
   for key terms — the index alone may miss relevant content.
③ **Read the relevant pages** using `read_file`.
④ **Synthesize an answer** from the compiled knowledge. Cite the wiki pages
   you drew from: "Based on [[page-a]] and [[page-b]]..."
⑤ **File valuable answers back** — if the answer is a substantial comparison,
   deep dive, or novel synthesis, create a page in `queries/` or `comparisons/`.
   Don't file trivial lookups — only answers that would be painful to re-derive.
⑥ **Update log.md** with the query and whether it was filed.

### 3. Lint

When the user asks to lint, health-check, or audit the wiki:

① **Orphan pages:** Find pages with no inbound `[[wikilinks]]` from other pages.
