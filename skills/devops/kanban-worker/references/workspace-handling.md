## Workspace handling

Your workspace kind determines how you should behave inside `$HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACE`:

| Kind | What it is | How to work |
|---|---|---|
| `scratch` | Fresh tmp dir, yours alone | Read/write freely; it gets GC'd when the task is archived. |
| `dir:<path>` | Shared persistent directory | Other runs will read what you write. Treat it like long-lived state. Path is guaranteed absolute (the kernel rejects relative paths). |
| `worktree` | Git worktree at the resolved path | If `.git` doesn't exist, run `git worktree add <path> ${HERMES_KANBAN_BRANCH:-wt/$HERMES_KANBAN_TASK}` from the main repo first, then cd and work normally. Commit work here. |
