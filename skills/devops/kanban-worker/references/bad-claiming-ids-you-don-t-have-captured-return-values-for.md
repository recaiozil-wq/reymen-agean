# BAD — claiming ids you don't have captured return values for.
kanban_complete(
    summary="Created remediation cards t_a1b2c3d4, t_deadbeef",  # hallucinated
    created_cards=["t_a1b2c3d4", "t_deadbeef"],                   # → gate rejects
)
```

If a `kanban_create` call fails (exception, tool_error), the card was NOT created — do not include a phantom id for it. Retry the create, or omit the id and mention the failure in your summary. The prose-scan pass also catches `t_<hex>` references in your free-form summary that don't resolve; these don't block the completion but show up as advisory warnings on the task in the dashboard.
