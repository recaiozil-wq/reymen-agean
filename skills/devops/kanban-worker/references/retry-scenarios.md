## Retry scenarios

If you open the task and `kanban_show` returns `runs: [...]` with one or more closed runs, you're a retry. The prior runs' `outcome` / `summary` / `error` tell you what didn't work. Don't repeat that path. Typical retry diagnostics:

- `outcome: "timed_out"` — the previous attempt hit `max_runtime_seconds`. You may need to chunk the work or shorten it.
- `outcome: "crashed"` — OOM or segfault. Reduce memory footprint.
- `outcome: "spawn_failed"` + `error: "..."` — usually a profile config issue (missing credential, bad PATH). Ask the human via `kanban_block` instead of retrying blindly.
- `outcome: "reclaimed"` + `summary: "task archived..."` — operator archived the task out from under the previous run; you probably shouldn't be running at all, check status carefully.
- `outcome: "blocked"` — a previous attempt blocked; the unblock comment should be in the thread by now.
