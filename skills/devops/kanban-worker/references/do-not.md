## Do NOT

- Call `delegate_task` as a substitute for `kanban_create`. `delegate_task` is for short reasoning subtasks inside YOUR run; `kanban_create` is for cross-agent handoffs that outlive one API loop.
- Call `clarify` to ask the human a question. You are running headless — there is no live user to answer. The call will time out (default ~120s) and the task will sit silently in `running` with no signal that it needs input. Use `kanban_comment` (context) + `kanban_block(reason=...)` (decision needed) instead — the task surfaces on the board as blocked, the operator sees it, unblocks with their answer in a comment, and you respawn with the thread.
- Modify files outside `$HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACE` unless the task body says to.
- Create follow-up tasks assigned to yourself — assign to the right specialist.
- Complete a task you didn't actually finish. Block it instead.
