## Decomposition playbook

### Step 1 — Understand the goal

Ask clarifying questions if the goal is ambiguous. Cheap to ask; expensive to spawn the wrong fleet.

### Step 2 — Sketch the task graph

Before creating anything, draft the graph out loud (in your response to the user). Treat every concrete workstream as a candidate card:

1. Extract the lanes from the request.
2. Map each lane to one of the profiles you discovered in Step 0. If a lane doesn't fit any existing profile, ask the user which to use or create.
3. Decide whether each lane is independent or gated by another lane.
4. Create independent lanes as parallel cards with no parent links.
5. Create synthesis/review/integration cards with parent links to the lanes they depend on. A child created with unfinished parents starts in `todo`; the dispatcher promotes it to `ready` only after every parent is done.

Examples of prompts that should fan out (using placeholder profile names — substitute whatever exists on the user's setup):

- "Build an app" → one card to a design-oriented profile for product/UI direction, one or two cards to engineering profiles for implementation, plus a later integration/review card if the user has a reviewer profile.
- "Fix blockers and check model variants" → one implementation card for the blocker fixes plus one discovery/research card for config/source verification. A final reviewer card can depend on both.
- "Research docs and implement" → a docs-research card can run in parallel with a codebase-discovery card; implementation waits only if it truly needs those findings.
- "Analyze this screenshot and find the related code" → one card to a vision-capable profile for the visual analysis while another searches the codebase.

Words like "also," "finally," or "and" do not automatically imply a dependency. They often mean "make sure this is covered before reporting back." Only link tasks when one card cannot start until another card's output exists.

Show the graph to the user before creating cards. Let them correct it — including which actual profile name should own each lane.

### Step 3 — Create tasks and link

Use the profile names from Step 0. The example below uses placeholders `<profile-A>`, `<profile-B>`, `<profile-C>` — replace them with what the user actually has.

```python
t1 = kanban_create(
    title="research: Postgres cost vs current",
    assignee="<profile-A>",  # whichever profile handles research on this setup
    body="Compare estimated infrastructure costs, migration costs, and ongoing ops costs over a 3-year window. Sources: AWS/GCP pricing, team time estimates, current Postgres bills from peers.",
    tenant=os.environ.get("HERMES_TENANT"),
)["task_id"]

t2 = kanban_create(
    title="research: Postgres performance vs current",
    assignee="<profile-A>",  # same profile, run in parallel
    body="Compare query latency, throughput, and scaling characteristics at our expected data volume (~500GB, 10k QPS peak). Sources: benchmark papers, public case studies, pgbench results if easy.",
)["task_id"]

t3 = kanban_create(
    title="synthesize migration recommendation",
    assignee="<profile-B>",  # whichever profile does synthesis/analysis
    body="Read the findings from T1 (cost) and T2 (performance). Produce a 1-page recommendation with explicit trade-offs and a go/no-go call.",
    parents=[t1, t2],
)["task_id"]

t4 = kanban_create(
    title="draft decision memo",
    assignee="<profile-C>",  # whichever profile drafts user-facing prose
    body="Turn the analyst's recommendation into a 2-page memo for the CTO. Match the tone of previous decision memos in the team's knowledge base.",
    parents=[t3],
)["task_id"]
```

`parents=[...]` gates promotion — children stay in `todo` until every parent reaches `done`, then auto-promote to `ready`. No manual coordination needed; the dispatcher and dependency engine handle it.

If the task graph has dependencies, create the parent cards first, capture their returned ids, and include those ids in the child card's `parents` list during the child `kanban_create` call. Avoid creating all cards in parallel and linking them afterward; that creates a window where the dispatcher can claim a child before its inputs exist.

### Step 4 — Complete your own task

If you were spawned as a task yourself (e.g. a planner profile was assigned `T0: "investigate Postgres migration"`), mark it done with a summary of what you created:

```python
kanban_complete(
    summary="decomposed into T1-T4: 2 research lanes in parallel, 1 synthesis on their outputs, 1 prose draft on the recommendation",
    metadata={
        "task_graph": {
            "T1": {"assignee": "<profile-A>", "parents": []},
            "T2": {"assignee": "<profile-A>", "parents": []},
            "T3": {"assignee": "<profile-B>", "parents": ["T1", "T2"]},
            "T4": {"assignee": "<profile-C>", "parents": ["T3"]},
        },
    },
)
```

### Step 5 — Report back to the user

Tell them what you created in plain prose, naming the actual profiles you used:

> I've queued 4 tasks:
> - **T1** (`<profile-A>`): cost comparison
> - **T2** (`<profile-A>`): performance comparison, in parallel with T1
> - **T3** (`<profile-B>`): synthesizes T1 + T2 into a recommendation
> - **T4** (`<profile-C>`): turns T3 into a CTO memo
>
> The dispatcher will pick up T1 and T2 now. T3 starts when both finish. You'll get a gateway ping when T4 completes. Use the dashboard or `hermes kanban tail <id>` to follow along.
